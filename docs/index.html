     <h1>Find By Image: Machine Learning for Artists</h1><br>This studio-based course aims to introduce machine learning—a complex and quickly evolving field—to artists, designers and performers.The goal of this course will be to unpack and familiarize ourselves with available machine learning tools, which we will put to use in planning and producing works of art. In-class labs will open a preliminary investigation into the conceptual and technical underpinnings of key machine learning methods, exploring their application through hands-on demonstrations. Readings and discussions will attempt to connect the theory, practice, and poetics of machine learning, and to place our efforts into a wider art-historical context. In the process, we will expand on the general phenomena of learning, experience, and creativity as subject matters in themselves.
