    "# Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook lays out one possible method for generating **word embeddings**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[_Word embeddings_](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) provide meaningful representations of words as they are used in context. Word embeddings [embed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding) words in high-dimensional space, mapping each word or phrase to its own [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space). Word embeddings are trained to help with a specific task, which determines its meaningulness as a representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the relationships between vectors can be meaningful (image from the [TensorFlow documentation]((https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/word2vec/index.html)):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Word embedding relationships](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/images/linear-relationships.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic with vectors can also be meaningful. Perhaps the most well-known example of this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{king} - \\text{man} + \\text{woman} = \\text{queen}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The positioning of these vectors in this space actually tells us something about *how these words are used*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to do things like find the most similar words by looking at the closest words. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, these word embeddings are trained to help with a particular task, which is learned through a neural network. Two tasks developed for training embeddings are _CBOW_ (\"Continuous Bag Of Words\") and _skip-grams_; together these methods of learning word embeddings are called \"[Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For the _CBOW_ task, we take the context words (the words around the target word) and give the target word. We want to predict whether or not the target word belongs to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _skip-gram_ is basically the inverse: we take the target word (also called the \"pivot\"), then give the context. We want to predict whether or not the context belongs to the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are quite similar but have different properties, e.g. _CBOW_ works better on small datasets, while _skip-grams_ work better for larger ones. In any case, the idea with word embeddings is that they can be trained to help with any task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we're going to be working on the _skip-gram_ task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a reasonably-sized text corpus to learn from. Here we'll use State of the Union addresses retrieved from [The American Presidency Project](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php). These addresses tend to use similar patterns so we should be able to learn some decent word embeddings. Since the skip-gram task looks at context, texts that use words in a consistent way (i.e. in consistent contexts) are easier to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The corpus is available here](https://github.com/publicityreform/findbyimage/raw/master/notebooks/word2vec/sotu.zip) as a compressed archive of .txt files. Download and un-zip this file and place it in the same directory as this notebook. The texts were preprocessed a bit (mainly removing URL-encoded characters). (nb: this isn't the complete collection of texts but enough to work with here).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Skip-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, let's get a bit more concrete about what the skip-gram task is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the sentence `\"I think cats are cool\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skip-gram task is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We take a word, e.g. `'cats'`, which we'll represent as $w_i$. We feed this as input into our neural network.\n",
    "- We take the word's context, e.g. `['I', 'think', 'are', 'cool']`. We'll represent this as $\\{w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, w_{i+1}, w_{i+2}\\}$ and we also feed this into our neural network.\n",
    "- Then we just want our network to predict (i.e. classify) whether or not $\\{w_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, w_{i+1}, w_{i+2}\\}$ is the true context of $w_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular example we'd want the network to output 1 (i.e. yes, that is the true context).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set $w_i$ to 'frogs', then we'd want the network output 0. In our one sentence corpus, `['I', 'think', 'are', 'cool']` is not the true context for 'frogs'. Sorry frogs 🐸.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Import dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll use [keras](https://keras.io/) to build the neural network that we'll use to learn the embeddings. keras is a high-level library that can use either a [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) backend to handle low-level tasks. to switch between tensorflow and theano backends, edit the keras configuration file at `$HOME/.keras/keras.json`"
